Experiment notes
============================

- Was Alex's near/far/centred data run from Alex's account. What was the monitor gammas being used? was "mitsubishi" successfully retrieved? It seems not, because on my machine, all monitors in monitor center only have gammas=1. Fortunately because my laptop was used for patient, also used gammas=1. Fajou ran everyone from his account on babyAsha, with gammas=1.
